<h1 id="remote-notifications">Remote notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-notifications" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h1>
<p>While Loop app currently sends notifications locally on Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers likely want those messages on their phones, too.  We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.</p>
<p>Traditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site.  The old Loop docs had set up for how to add your <code>PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY</code> , <code>PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN</code>, and <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code> in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers.  The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine-tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgment requirement.  If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself.</p>
<p>Using Pushover <i><strong>THROUGH</strong></i> IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones.  For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her Dexcom is about to expire in the next day.  S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures.  Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too.  If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue.  A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alert when the school nurse boluses for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful.  Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily.</p>
<p>The basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was "Maker Webhooks" hence you may see references to "maker" in NS docs).  Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/ns-core-events.png" width="700">
</p>

<p>For this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called <code>ns-event</code>.  You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification.</p>
<p>As a brief roadmap for what we are going to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get necessary accounts setup</li>
<li>Add a folder to your Google Drive</li>
<li>Make an IFTTT applet to log NS events to your Google Spreadsheets</li>
<li>Enable NS to work with that new IFTTT applet</li>
<li>Make an IFTTT applet to send Pushover alert when the Google Spreadsheet is updated</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="get-prepped">Get Prepped<a class="headerlink" href="#get-prepped" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>If you don't already have these steps done, you will need them.  Skip any that you already have done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a Nightscout site</li>
<li>Get an <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT account</a></li>
<li>Get a <a href="https://pushover.net">Pushover Account</a></li>
<li>Get a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp">Google Account</a></li>
<li>Download the Pushover app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to receive Pushover alerts</li>
<li>Download the IFTTT app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to use IFTTT applets on</li>
<li>Login to the Pushover and IFTTT apps with your login information</li>

</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/google3.png" width="550">
</p>

<p>This IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will eventually contain numerous Google Spreadsheets, one for each NS alarm or information that is logged.  As new alarms are triggered, the IFTTT applet we are about to write will add a row to the appropriate spreadsheet logging the time of the alarm and any other reported details that go with the entry.  For now though, your drive will be blank...screenshot below just to give you an idea of where we are going.</p>

<p>Putting all these notifications together may cause you to want to revisit the alert levels you have set in your Heroku settings.  Here's a short summary of NS for the looping-related alerts (Note: the last row, Upbat, is the Looping iPhone battery level for Loop users; or the rig's battery level for OpenAPS users.)  If you'd like some of these alarms for your site and don't currently have them activated (they are all off by default unless specifically turned on), the lines you'd need to add are in the last column.  If you like the default values of the WARN and/or URGENT, you don't have to add those extra lines...just the line to enable the alerts will be sufficient.</p>

<p>You can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet.  For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iPhone instead of Pushover.  The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily.  Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service.  This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows.  If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be clear, you do <i><strong>NOT</strong></i> need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code>, <code>PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN</code>, or <code>PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY</code> entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work.  This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into its code.  This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for.  You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collector).</p>

<ul>
<li>The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet.  After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet.  For most alarms, it may take quite some time to reach 2000 rows of info.  For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper.  You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.</li>
